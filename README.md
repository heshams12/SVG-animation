# SVG-animation
Created a generic landing page using Adobe XD along with an SVG from adobe illustrator.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge in Adobe XD and illustrator by creating a generic landing page and an SVG.
I then used CSS animations to make the SVG come to life when a user hovers over the SVG it iterates the motion of the piece coming together with background.
